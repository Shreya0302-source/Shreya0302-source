### 🧠 About Me

I'm a mechanical engineering graduate with a growing passion for integrating artificial intelligence with traditional engineering processes. With experience in **mechanical design**, **simulation**, and **3D printing**, I’ve recently focused on using **machine learning to optimize materials, processes, and product performance**.

Whether it's designing a **gearbox** or predicting **weld strength** using **AI algorithms**, I aim to bridge physical design with digital intelligence.

### 🔬 What I Do

- 💡 Design & simulate mechanical systems using tools like **SolidWorks**, **ANSYS**, and **3DX SIMULIA**.
- 🧪 Fabricate prototypes using **3D Printing** and test for mechanical properties.
- 🤖 Apply **Machine Learning** to engineering problems (e.g., predictive models for roughness, dimensional accuracy, lattice strength).
- ✍️ Write and publish **peer-reviewed research papers** in recognized journals.
